# Pandemic Simulation Project
This is a group project of three. We built up a pandemic model, which simulates the spread of an epidemic in a population under different conditions.

In this model, you may customize the properties of virus, the size of area, the number of people, the moving strategies of the crowd, whether or not wearing mask and got vaccinated, and so on.

I acted as the leader of this project, and contribute the major part of code.
